This is a literature review talk of the paper [PLMs as Meta-function: Learning In-context Learning for Named Entity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11038). The slides can be found [here](../files/2023-12-21-talk-1.pdf). This is my first time to give a talk, and I think it is meaningful though I know there are some problems in the slides.
